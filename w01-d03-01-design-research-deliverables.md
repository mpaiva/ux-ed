- Have a good understanding of deliverables that come out of user research 
- Use affinity diagraming as part of your analysis process
- Use mind mapping as part of your brainstorming process
- Create a user types matrix
- Create a persona
- Create a storyboard comic

# RECAP: The User-Centered Product Development Lifecycle

---

## ISO Standard: 13407
- Specify the context of use: Identify the people who will use the product, what they will use it for, and under what conditions they will use it.

- Specify requirements: Identify any business requirements or user goals that must be met for the product to be successful.

---

## ISO Standard: 13407 (Cont'd)

- Create design solutions: This part of the process may be done in stages, building from a rough concept to a complete design.

- Evaluate designs: The most important part of this process is that evaluation - ideally through usability testing with actual users - is as integral as quality testing is to good software development.

## AFFINITY DIAGRAMMING
![](https://i.imgur.com/Ybuga7O.jpg)

---

#### AFFINITY DIAGRAMMING
# What is it?

- A method used to cluster findings so that you can physically see trends and relationships in data.
- Often have hundreds or thousands of pieces of data to organize.
- "Affinity" means that things are similar. 

---

http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/affinity

> Affinity diagraming is a "bottom-up" activity where you group detailed findings together first, and that bubbles up to higher level trends. You do not start by creating categories first and then assigning individual findings into a category. 

---

#### AFFINITY DIAGRAMMING
# What is it good for?

- Initial phases of anyalysis where you have a lot of data and don't know where to start. 

---

#### AFFINITY DIAGRAMMING
# - How do you do it?

- Write down each finding on a sticky note.
- Find a large wall that you can use.
- Read each sticky note aloud and place on wall. 
- Position related items together.

---

#### AFFINITY DIAGRAMMING
# Tips & Tricks

- Use a wall that you can leave the stickies up for a while or use large pieces of paper as your backdrop so you can fold it up and take it with you. 
- Use different colored sticky notes for different data. 
  - EX: different colors can signify data from different user types. 
  - EX: different colors can signify types of data (observation, category)

## MIND-MAPPING

---

#### MIND-MAPPING
# What is it?

- A method to visually represent brainstorming ideas
- Supports non-linear thinking.

---

#### MIND-MAPPING
# What is it good for?

- Thinking / brainstorming about a problem space. 
- One idea leads to another, or several. Often you loop back and create a different branch.
- Visually see how concepts are related.

---

#### MIND-MAPPING
# How do you do it?

- Create a topic in the center of the page. 
- For each topic, write the word and draw a simple picture of it.
- Draw branches out from the main topic. Use different colors for each branch. You can have sub-branches within each main branch.
- Include all ideas during the brainstorming session. 
- Think about problems, challenges, solutions, activities, tools, facts, etc.
- The mind map is only one piece of paper.

---

#### MIND-MAPPING
# Tips & Tricks

- If you run out of ideas, take 2 minutes and look at what you've drawn. For each topic you've drawn, ask yourself "Why?" Often this will branch out another idea.

---

## USER TYPES
![](https://i.imgur.com/gLYwNbF.jpg)

---

#### USER TYPES
# What is it?

- A matrix that represents the different types of users you need to think about for your product.
- Often different user types will have different roles and functionality for your product.

---

#### USER TYPES
# What is it good for?

- Have a snapshot view of your different user types.
- Working document to see similarities and differences between roles.

---

#### USER TYPES
# How do you do it?

- Write each user type in columns across the top of your worksheet.
- Each row represents different demographic and behavioral data you want to capture about the user type. 
  - EX: Age, tech savviness, device they are using, location they are using, primary language, goals, pain points, features they want, value proposition

---

#### USER TYPES
# Tips & Tricks

- User Types matrixes are living documents. Add and combine user types as you do research. Add additional attributes that come out of your research. 
- These are the basis for your personas. 

---

## PERSONAS
![](https://i.imgur.com/cmedP22.jpg)

---

#### PERSONAS
# What is it?

- Fictional characters that represent user types for your product.
- Describe demographics, behaviors, and attitudes.
- Helpful in brainstorming, communicating, building empathy.

---

#### PERSONAS
# What is it good for?

- Personas help drive feature definition. 
- Help personalize the product for employees
- Build consensus and understanding of users

---

#### PERSONAS
# How do you do it?

- Start with your user types matrix. Each user types becomes a persona.
- Use a template to get all the data on the page.
- Use PowerPoint, Word, Google Slides, or Photoshop
- Personas are a one-page view into your user.
- Often you have to guess about details of your persona. This should be refined based on user research.

---

#### PERSONAS
# Tips & Tricks

- When you talk about your user, talk about your persona. This has a psychological effect that you are creating a product for a person, not for a faceless user.
- Print and post these where you work.
- Use personas and user types to create questionnaire screeners to recruit for user research.
- Use personas to help think of test scenarios. 

---

## STORYBOARD COMICS
![](https://i.imgur.com/oTgN0xn.jpg)

---

#### STORYBOARD COMICS
# What is it?

- A visual story about your customer using your product.

---

#### STORYBOARD COMICS
# What is it good for?

- Sets context for why a user is using your product. What is going on around them?
- Helps in brainstorming features for a product.

---

#### STORYBOARD COMICS
# How do you do it?

- Draw 3 squares. Fill them in. 
- Show not tell. Limited use of words.
- Include sounds and conversation. 
- Show time passing.

---

#### STORYBOARD COMICS
# Tips & Tricks

- Stick figures are fine. 
- Doesn't have to be beautiful art. The goal is to tell a story. 
- Remember to include what is going on around them. 
- What happened just before they had to use your product?
