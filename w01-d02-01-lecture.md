# The User-Centered Product Development Lifecycle

---

## ISO Standard: 13407

- Specify the context of use: Identify the people who will use the product, what they will use it for, and under what conditions they will use it.

---

## ISO Standard: 13407

- Specify requirements: Identify any business requirements or user goals that must be met for the product to be successful.

---

## ISO Standard: 13407

- Create design solutions: This part of the process may be done in stages, building from a rough concept to a complete design.

---

## ISO Standard: 13407

- Evaluate designs: The most important part of this process is that evaluation - ideally through usability testing with actual users - is as integral as quality testing is to good software development.

## INTERVIEWS
![](https://i.imgur.com/ui08ZvF.jpg)

---

#### INTERVIEWS
## What is it good for?

- Explore a topic. When you don't know what you are looking for yet, start with interviews & ethnography.
- Drive into details. When you know a topic well, and you are looking for specific answers.

---

#### INTERVIEWS
## What is it?

- \# of Participants: 3-5 per user type 
- \# of Moderators: 1
- Location: in person, remote
- Length: 20-30 minutes

---

#### INTERVIEWS
## How do you do it?

1. Identify goal (pain points, features)
2. Prepare interview script
3. Screen, recruit, & schedule participants
4. Remind participant day before
5. Introduction
6. Ask questions
7. Do they have any questions
8. Thanks and goodbye

---

#### INTERVIEWS
## Tips & Tricks

- Donâ€™t go over. Be respectful of their time. They are doing you a favor. 
- Wear a name-tag to help your participant remember your name. 
- Record the interview (asking permission first) or have someone take notes for you. 
- Self-reported data can be inaccurate.

---

## FOCUS GROUPS
